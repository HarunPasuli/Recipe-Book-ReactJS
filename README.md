# Recipe Book 
## This website is a recipe book so users can create, read , update and delete recipes they have added and to keep track of recipes they've enjoyed, the website is currently a work in progress.

This website is just made to improve my CRUD with ReactJS as it's my first CRUD project and probably going to use just ReactJS without any backend for this.

# CRUD
# Local Storage
# User Dashboard 
# React Routers

## You have a list to all the routes in App.jsx or you could go to `localhot:5173/dashboard` 

# To install this project you need to do the following:
1. Clone the project
2. run `npm install` or just `npm i` for Vite
3. run `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` and `npx tailwindcss init -p` for Tailwind
4. Might need to run `npm install react-toastify` and `npm install @emailjs/browser` for notifications and email JS
5. if you decide to use the contact form then you need to create an EmailJS form and fill in the info in ContactForm.jsx
6. run `npm run dev` open localhost:5173 and enjoy! :D

## How to tweak this project for your own uses
Since this is a personal project that was made to improve my ReactJS knowledge as a beginner, I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project for your own purposes.

# Bugs:
## Images not working 
## Navbar under 450px isn't responsive anymore
